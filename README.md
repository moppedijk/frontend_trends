# Xebia Assessment

This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is created for Xebia to showcase my skills in developing a quick application with external data. This prototype uses Webpack as module bundler, Reactjs for the user interface and node to invoke API calls to the Google Trends API.

The application is deployed on Heroku, [click on this link](https://xebia-assessment.herokuapp.com/). If the application does not respond this means the server is inactive or online.
